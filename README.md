## Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) installed.

Navigate to the primary plugin folder and run NPM install for the plugin
```bash
cd chat-clickable-messages
npm install
```

Navigate to the serverless folder, create and modify the .env file
```bash
cd ..
cd serverless
***rename the .env.example file to .env and change the below:
ACCOUNT_SID= Found at https://www.twilio.com/console
AUTH_TOKEN= Found at https://www.twilio.com/console 
TWILIO_WORKSPACE_SID = WSXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Run NPM install for the serverless functions
```bash
Run: (from the serverless directory)
npm install
```

Install the twilio serverless functions
```bash
Run: 
twilio plugins:install @twilio-labs/plugin-serverless
```

Deploy the serverless functions into Twilio
*Do this if you haven't deployed the serverless functions already*
```bash
Run: 
twilio serverless:deploy
```
Copy the domain as you'll need this for the .env as you'll use this when you import the studio flow

Import the Studio Flow located within /serverless/studio_flow, you'll find below how to import a json within the console:
https://www.twilio.com/console/studio/dashboard


![Plugin Demo](https://github.com/aestellwag/flex-selectable-chat-messages/blob/main/studio-flow-import-viaJSON.gif)

From you'll need to update the function widget within the Studio Flow to point to your function

From the public folder, create the appConfig.js and change on variable within it
```bash
cd public
cd assets
rename webchat-appConfig.example.js to webchat-appConfig.js

change accountSID: "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
and flexFlowSID: "FOXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```



## Development

In order to develop locally, you can use the Webpack Dev Server by running (from the root plugin directory):

```bash
npm start
```

This will automatically start up the Webpack Dev Server and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:3000`. If you want to change that you can do this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

When you make changes to your code, the browser window will be automatically refreshed.

## Deploy

When you are ready to deploy your web chat widget, you'll need to run build
```
Run: 
npm run-script build
```
